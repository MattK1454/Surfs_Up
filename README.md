# Surfs Up Oahu Surf & Ice cream shop climate analysis project
Data modelling project using python, sqlite, and jupyter notebooks

## Overview

In order to expand our understanding of the overall climate variance and weather conditions for our ice cream and surf shop, we collected all of the temperature readings in the month most commonly associated with Summer seasonal weather and the temperature readings in the month most commonly associated with Winter seasonal weather: June and December respectively.

## Results

![June temperature stats](https://github.com/MattK1454/Surfs_Up/blob/main/June_temp_stats.png)

Above is a statistical analysis of the June temperature readings for Oahu.

![December temperature stats](https://github.com/MattK1454/Surfs_Up/blob/main/December_temp_stats.png)

Above is a statistical analysis of the December temperature readings for Oahu.

Looking at the above statistical anaysis, 3 points regarding the two months should be addressed:

* The June temperatures analysis was conducted on 1700 samples where as Decembers data contains 1517 sample points. This suggests that June's statistical analysis will be more accurate.
* The average temperature in June was 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit where as December's average temperature was 71.04 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a difference of 3.9 degress F in average temperture over the year.
